# node-xdotool-websocket

Use together with noVNC fork, this VNC can accept relative mouse movement instead of absolute positions.

(therefore can be used in gaming such as Minecraft, which a fix is located in GLFW 3.4 in the future, which will be included in LWJGL, and finally merged into Minecraft code base... and let's hope that fix is not for windows platform only)
